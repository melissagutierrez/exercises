    the most effective way to visualize it ... unfamilarity makes them

    // There's one problem with radar charts: to overlay too many
    // measurements may confuse the reader even though they offer
    // comparisons.

    // A few options might be:

    // - Limit the number data sets you present at any one time.
    //   Instead of showing the entire starting lineup, display
    //   Miami's 'Big Three' (Bosh, James and Wade).

    // - Build a chart for each player and display them next to
    //   each other. If the differences are drastic enough, a
    //   user will be able to see them.

    // - Add interactivity. (I know, I know - - we're getting there!)
    //   Give a user the option of displaying as many data sets as
    //   they can handle.
