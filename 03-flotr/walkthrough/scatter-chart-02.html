      // So we don't have to process the data let's just hard-code it.

      // The data we processed before did not add colors to
      // differentiate one player from another. And since we're still
      // doing static charts, there's no mouseover-tool tip to give us
      // indication as to which dot is for which player. So color is
      // our best option at the moment.

      // We can see flaw in this chart format (and library) in that too
      // many players could lead to overlap, an unweildy key and too
      // many colors (and what happens if we show two players from one
      // team?).
