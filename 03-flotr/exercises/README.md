# 03 Flotr2

Flotr2 is a JavaScript library used for drawing charts and graphs using HTML5's canvas element. It is capable of generating several types of interactive charts. Its configuration is created using a JavaScript object.

## Building Charts

Over the next two weeks, find data sets related to your subject of choice suitable for building (one of) each of the following charts:

**Due Feb. 20:**
- bar chart
- line chart
- pie chart

**Due Feb. 27:**
- scatter chart
- bubble chart
- radar chart

Include these as individual pages in your exercise portfolio. Include a short write-up on the cases in which it is suitable/ideal to use this type of chart as well as a short description of the information you are presenting in the chart.

We will do a peer review of these in class.

When developing your data set, be sure to keep a copy of the raw data. This can either be an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file.
