# 04 Interactivity

This week we're working with [Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/), a charting library similar to Flotr2, and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to enhance our charts with interactive features.

While it is not identical, Flot is very similar to Flotr2 as it uses a similar setup structure (target element, data, options). It requires the jQuery library.

jQuery simplifies numerous JavaScript tasks. It is well known for its philosophy of 'method chaining'.


## Building Charts

Over the next week, find a data set related to your subject of choice and build two (separate) line charts, demonstrating the options for a user to:

- select which data is to be displayed
- zoom in on a specific portion of the chart (and reset the chart)

You may repurpose data from the  '03-flotr' exercise on the condition your data contains enough points and  sets. It is possible you may need to add more points or sets to make the interactive features you are building worthwhile.

If your data meets the condition, you may use it for each of the examples -- one data set, two interactive charts. (For instance, do we really need 'select' options if three varying lines exist; do we need to zoom in if the depth will only show two or three points?) If you still feel uncomfortable preparing data, however, it can't hurt to keep practicing with two data sets.

Either way, remember, you will be rebuilding charts with a new library. So be prepared to make tweaks!

Be sure to 'clean up' your charts based on any peer feedback received in class.

Include these new examples as individual pages in your exercise portfolio. Include a short write-up on the cases in which it is suitable/ideal to use this type of interactive feature as well as a short description of the information you are presenting in the chart.

We will do a peer review of these in class.

When developing your data set, be sure to keep a copy of the raw data. This can either be an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file.
