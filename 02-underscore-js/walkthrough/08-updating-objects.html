      // A note about *updating* objects. Be very thoughtful of what
      // data you may be updating. If your data is provided from an
      // official source, do you really want to change it? Doing so
      // may present the user with incorrect information.

      // Where might you update data? If, say, a property in a weather
      // feed gives you "fahrenheit", you may want to change it to "F".
      // This would be appropriate; but if you were to change data to
      // influence presentation ... bad. :<


      // _.extend(standard, order);
      // .extend() starts with one object then adds properties based on
      // the other object and *overrides* properties with new values.
      // See: http://underscorejs.org/#extend

      // _.defaults(order, standard)
      // .defaults() starts with one object and adds properties based
      // on the other(s) but leaves the original properties unchanged.
      // See: http://underscorejs.org/#defaults

      // NOTE: In both cases, the objects are not copied; they are
      // *modified* directly. To use either method that does not
      // modify the input, store the result in a variable and use an
      // empty object ({}) as the first argument.

      // var pizza = _.extend({}, standard, order);
