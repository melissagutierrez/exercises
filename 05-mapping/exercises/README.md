# 05 Mapping

This week we're working with SVGs and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), a library which allows us to map data.


## SVGs

Over the next week, find a data set ideal for a choropleth map. Create the data set, collect a count for the data and apply it to the map.

Be sure to add a legend and title to your map (unlike the example in class). You may want to create a data set of colors so they can be applied to both the map and legend.


## Leaflet

Using Leaflet, create an interactive map of the college where you obtained your undergraduate degree. Apply the following:

- The correct zoom size/center location. If your campus is massive and stretches beyond your container, make sure the heart is visible to the user.

- Place a marker at the building where you attended most of your classes (the school of your major). In your popup, provide a small blurb about the school and a link to the web site.

- Use polygons (or circles, if applicable) to identify 3-5 of your favorite places on campus. Create a dataset which includes the polygon/circle coordinates, as well as a description of the location (and maybe what was so special about it.) Iterate over this data set to apply the the polygon/circles.

- Consider adjusting the colors used on the map to reflect your school's colors. Are there any other indicators you need to give the users to interact with your map?
